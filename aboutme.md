### My history

<div style="text-align: justify">
Raised in the Antilles, educated in Europe and trained as a researcher around the world to better understand the impact of plant-soil interactions on the dynamics and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. During my Ph.D., I have been interested in better understanding the impact of the symbiotic association between trees and fungi on the distribution, dynamics and functioning of forests and especially maple forests in Québec. To explore the aboveground-belowground linkages, I combines a wide variety of approaches ranging from greenhouse and field experiments to bioinformatics and modelling. I am constantly looking for new methods and I also trying to share them to the best of my knowledge. Before that, I had the privilege of studying in several universities in Europe and participated in different research projects around the world. When I was not doing research, I taught biology, geology and sustainable development to teenagers.
