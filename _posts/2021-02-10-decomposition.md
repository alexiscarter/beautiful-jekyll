What if ectomycorrhizas actually accelerate decomposition to a greater extent than arbuscular mycorrhizas in a northern deciduous forest?

❌ No “Gadgil effect” was observed in ectomycorrhizal (EcM) forests  
🍄 Decomposition was faster in EcM vs. arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) forests  
🐌 Restricting access to external fungal hyphae slowed down decomposition in AM forests
