Mountane ecosystems provide amazing opportunities to study the responses of plant along environmental gradients. Almost 10 years of research on this theme has been led by the group of Mark Vellend in Mont Mégantic National Park (Québec, Canada). A synthesis paper is on its way, with a particular focus on sugar maple and the research I did during my PhD.

I am fascinated by such study systems as well as dune ecosystems. Hopefully, the article will soon be available!

Some of the research have already been published and covered by the media ([La Presse](https://www.lapresse.ca/actualites/environnement/2020-01-13/changements-climatiques-des-erables-dans-la-foret-boreale), [Science Daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/01/200113075841.htm))
