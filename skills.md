## Data manipulation and analyses

As an R enthousiast, I mainly used this progamming language. I present some examples below.

**Modeling**  
Using linear, mixed, generalized and hurdle models.

**Multivariate approach**
![](/img/Fig4.jpg)Constrained ordination of a fungal community by soil chemistry variables using a distance-based redundancy analysis with Bray-Curtis dissimilarities.

**Spatial visualization**
![](/img/map_world_ecmprop.jpg)Ectomycorrhizal tree proportion across the globe (data from Steidinger et al. 2019 https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-019-1128-0).

**Large database management**
![](/img/map_us_rich.jpg)Tree richness at the community scale across the U.S. calculated for ~85,00 plots containing >2 million trees, retrieved from the FIA database (https://apps.fs.usda.gov/fia/datamart/).

## Metabarcoding

**DNA extraction and amplification**  
Using primers for fungi (ITS and LSU) and plants (rbcL).

**Analyses of sequencing data**

## Soft skills  
**Language**  
My mother tongue is French. I am fluent in English. Also intermediate in Spanish and beginner in Portguese.  
I really enjoy learning about new languages and local cultures.

**Strong team player**
