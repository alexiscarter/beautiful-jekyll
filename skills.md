## Data manipulation and analyses

As an R enthousiast, I mainly used this progamming language.

- Modeling: Using linear, mixed, generalized and hurdle models

- Multivariate approach

- Spatial visualization

- Large database management

## Metabarcoding

- DNA extraction and amplification  
Using primers for fungi (ITS and LSU) and plants (rbcL)

- Analyses of sequencing data
