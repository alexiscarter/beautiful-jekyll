## Data manipulation and analyses

As an R enthousiast, I mainly used this progamming language. I present some examples below.

**Modeling**

**Multivariate approach**

**Spatial visualization**

**Large database management**
![](/img/map_us_rich.jpg)Tree richness at the community scale across the U.S. calculated for ~85,00 plots containing >2 million trees, retrieved from the FIA database (https://apps.fs.usda.gov/fia/datamart/).

**Meta-analyses**  
I have followed several workshops given about meta-analysis and hope put it in practice very soon!

## Metabarcoding

**DNA extraction and amplification**  
Using primers for fungi (ITS and LSU) and plants (rbcL).

**Analyses of sequencing data**

Percentage of reads per samples kept after different steps of denoising.

eDNA metabarcoding: From raw data to RDA (fun bilingual tutorials on DADA2 and phyloseq [here](https://alexiscarter.github.io/metab/)).

## Soft skills  
**Language**  
My mother tongue is French. I am fluent in English. Also intermediate in Spanish and beginner in Portguese.  
I really enjoy learning about new languages and local cultures.

**Teaching**  
I love teaching and have had the opportunity to share my passion and knowledge with students of different ages and backgrounds.

- 2019: Lecturer, Plant ecology fieldwork course, Université de Montréal, Canada (Student satisfaction score: 96%).
- 2018: Teaching assistant, Fungal diversity course, Université de Montréal, Canada.
- 2016, 2017, 2018: Head teaching assistant, Plant ecology fieldwork course, Université de Montréal, Canada.
- 2016: Tutor, Biodiversity course, Université de Montréal, Canada
- September 2015-December 2015 and September 2013-June 2014: Secondary school teacher in biology and geology in France.
- October 2014-May 2015: Civic service volunteer, environmental educator, Brest, France.

I also had the chance to take several workshops to *learn* how to teach.

**Student supervision and mentoring**  
Most of the time teamwork is successful or even necessary to do research. I really enjoy working with others and I believe to be a strong team player. I had the opportunity to work with great mentors. In my turn, I have mentored and supervised amazing research assistants:
- Mathilde L.: B.Sc. in biological sciences, Université de Montréal, Canada (September-December 2018)
- Florence B.: B.Sc. in biological sciences, Université de Montréal, Canada (May-August 2018)
- Fabien C.: M.Sc. in biodiversity, ecology and evolution, Université Aix Marseille (March-August 2018)
- Florian P.: Environmental engineering, École nationale des travaux publics de l'état, France (April-August 2017)
- Rose-Marie G.: Diploma in Bio-ecology, Cégep de Sherbrooke (May-July 2017)
- Émilie T.: B.Sc. in biological sciences, Université de Montréal, Canada (August-October 2016)
- Rosalie B.: B.Sc. in biological sciences, Université de Montréal, Canada (August-September 2016)
- Joric G.: B.Sc. in biological sciences, Université de Montréal, Canada (July-August 2016)
- Vlad P.: Horticultural engineering, AgroCampus Ouest, France (June-August 2016)
- Azucena H.: Sustainable development engineering, Instituto Tecnológico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey, Mexico (May-August 2016)
- Myriam L.: B.Sc. in biological sciences, Université de Montréal, Canada (May-August 2016)
- Marie B.: Biotechnology engineering, école d’ingénieurs Polytech Marseille, France (May-July 2016)
