#### Project
Is Ecosystem Carbon Storage Mediated by Mycorrhiza? An Experiment from Co-occurring Forests Dominated by Arbuscular Mycorrhizal or Ectomycorrhizal

#### Context
Microorganisms, both above and belowground have a major impact in ecosystem functioning. In particular, an ecosystem function such as carbon cycling is of societal and scientific interest because of its key role in climate change. The aboveground-belowground feedbacks between biotic and abiotic factors control the accumulation and stability of soil carbon. Therefore, understanding the role of soil microorganisms for carbon cycling is fundamental to increase our capacity to predict ecosystem functioning, the future climate of the Earth, and ecosystem response to climate change.
